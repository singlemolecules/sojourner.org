I created this site mean to communicate technical how-to and tips on single molecule data analysis. However, in this special hard time, I will start with my story. 

In this Covid-19 pandemic, like everyone else, I am locked down at home in Vancouver Canada, even though I’ve located a research position in China. To be able to continue work on single molecule technologies; and get my bill paid. I am doing freelancing data analysis work, with the help of my friend. 

If you have a need for single molecule data analysis, or you’ve met a problem during the process, I am here to help!

ABOUT US

I worked on single molecule data analysis during my postdoc at Johns Hopkins University, see my work here; and epigenomic sequencing data analysis during my PhD at University of British Columbia, here is my code and paper. 

So, I think it is fair to say I have a good amount of experience in the computational biology. And what’s more, this time I am teaming up with Dr. Ling Wei, my formal physicist colleagues at JHU (see her work here) for the analysis. She had her PhD in soft matter physics, and would chime in on a part-time basis to help out the physics side of things. 

SERVICE

Together, we provide consultation and code development on single molecule data analysis: 

- Identify a clear and concise question to answer. 
From complex biological inquiries, identify a clear and concise data analysis question to answer; as well as a way to verify the success or failure of the analysis.  

- Data wrangling.
Locating or generating control datasets for question verification; cleaning, masking and formatting dataset into proper type to feed in the next algorithms. 

- Applying physics, statistics, and machine learning algorithms.
Identifying applicable algorithms in physics, statistics and machine learning for the question at hand; addressing appropriateness in selection, as well as parameters of algorithms; evaluating the assumptions, precautions and potential drawbacks for the analysis. 

Note we only do single molecule related data analysis. The service is offered through consultation and code development for the pro version of sojourner.  


PRICING

I’ve made effort to make billing policy fair. I will bill only on the goals completed. And for multi-step agile development, bill to the agreed upon sprint that was completed.

You can go with either
- Ad hoc analysis 
billed on the hours agreed upon, at 50$/h;
- Subscription
Billed 1000$ every two-weeks. That is 4h/day, 40h biweekly, at 25$/h (equivalent to postdoc wage rate in the States)

Both ways, you will have access to nightly built sojourner.pro (renewal yearly, what’s in sojourner.pro), and have analysis software built customized to your need. 

If it all made sense to you so far, you can schedule a 15min session to see if we could be of help to you (here); or you can directly throw a feature request and see if the result satisfies your need.
