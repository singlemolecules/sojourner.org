> *Sojourner.Pro* is an add-on software for *Sojourner* with advanced analysis features. Given *Sojourner* focuses on biometric based statistical analysis; *Sojourner.pro* is all about applying machine learning and deep learning algorithms on biophysical metrics-based modelling; with the intend to further classify types of diffusion and states of the molecules. 

The machine learning algorithms in PRO currently includes Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Artificial Neuron Network (ANN) (under develop) to predict molecule states and state associated parameters. They are primarily implemented in Python programing language with native integration of machine learning and deep learning libraries, and presented in R for ease-of-use for *Sojourner* users. Besides features, the PRO also comes with dedicated support through email. See table below for a detailed comparison.
