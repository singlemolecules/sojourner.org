> During this Covid-19 pandemic, like many, I am locked down at home in Vancouver Canada, although I’ve located an associate investigator position and will serve as director of Bioimaging Center at Tongji university in China. I am expected to be onboarding once the disease ends in a few month; however for now, to be able to get my bills paid and continue work on single molecule data analysis, I am freelancing on data analysis during this period of time with my physicist colleague. After I am onboarded, I won’t need to provide this service anymore, but my development and support for *Sojourner* and *Sojourner.Pro*. will continue if not more, as I myself will become the primary user.

if you 

- just started on single molecule and would like some help to get things rolling on the computation side;
- need an extra hand to help move some roadblocks on your analysis expenditure; 
- want some help for data crunching for publications on computation side. 

We are here to help! 

**ABOUT US**

I worked on single molecule data analysis during my postdoc at Johns Hopkins University, see my work here; and epigenomic sequencing data analysis during my PhD at University of British Columbia, here is my code and paper.

So, I think it is fair to say I have a good amount of experience in the computational biology. And what’s more, this time I am teaming up with Dr. Ling Wei, my formal physicist colleagues at JHU (see her work here) for the analysis. She had her PhD in soft matter physics, and would chime in on a part-time basis to help out the physics side of things.

**SERVICE**

Together, we provide consultation and code development on single molecule data analysis:

* Identify a clear and concise question to answer. From complex biological inquiries, identify a clear and concise data analysis question to answer; as well as a way to verify the success or failure of the analysis. 
* Data wrangling. Locating or generating control datasets for question verification; cleaning, masking and formatting dataset into proper type to feed in the next algorithms. 
* Applying physics, statistics, and machine learning algorithms. Identifying applicable algorithms for the question at hand; addressing appropriateness in model selection, parameters optimization; evaluating the assumptions, precautions and potential drawbacks of the analysis.

What we do:

- review literatures on computational methods of single molecule data analysis, keep you updated with progress in single molecule analysis. 
- understanding of the algo and application of algo in data analysis. This includes heavy duty data wrangling, model fitting, and parameter optimization work as described above, to help you gain a good understanding of the algo and pros and cons in applications of the ago. 
- constructing de novo algos for specific analysis tasks required for the lab, and scripting pipelines for automating analysis tasks.
- helping researchers completing their computational aspects of their projects; mentoring students for data analysis techniques. 

We help you solve problems in single molecule data analysis, in particular single molecule tracking data. The service is offered through consultation and code development for the PRO version of sojourner. 

**PRICING**

Subscription is billed **2000$ /month** for 87 hours /month, @4h/day, **23$/hour** (equivalent to postdoc wage rate in the States). You will automatically given a **one year subscription of *Sojourner.Pro*** and have analysis software built customized to your need.

Subscribe to the service when you needed it, cancel it when you are done. No fixed term contract. No hidden fees and tax included; 2 week money back guarantee if you are not satisfied with the solution.
