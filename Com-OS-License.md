#### **1. Commercial Open Source License Q&A**

- **Where is the commercial license and how does it work?**

  The commercial license is included in the root folder of Sojourner.Pro (COMOS-LICENSE). Every computer running the Pro within purchaser’s group is under the supervision of this commercial license. 

  Upon subscription, You, the subscriber is given access to the source code of Sojourner.Pro, as well as priority support. You will receive new features and bug fixes through source code updates, and priority support through email. 

  Currently, you will need a GitHub account to access the source code via forking. This GitHub account is the point of contact for all the services. We are exploring single-sign-on authentication process, so anyone with a Personal Access Token (key) can have access, instead of requiring a GitHub account. 

  Once you receive the key, or being granted access to the source code repository, you can download and install the Pro, there is no restrain on the number of users within a subscriber’s group. 

- **What does the COMOS-LICENSE require?**

  The license agreement requires you, the subscriber, keep the access private within your group. If we found your access key are ever publicized, you will be required to remove the publicized content and send a new email address so we can grant your access. Access via old email will stop working. If this had happened multiple times, we reserve the right to revoke access of the user permanently. 

- **What happens when my subscription expires?**

  You shall keep an active subscription to maintain your access. Once your subscription expires, you lose your access to the source code and your priority support. This means you won’t get any updates or bug fixes, and no more email support for issues relate to it. You have a 14 days grace period to pay off your bill. 

- **Will my subscription price remain the same?**

  Yes. Once you purchased a subscription, you keep that price forever as long as you continue to pay it in time. If your subscription expires longer than the 14-day grace period, and you wish to resume it, you will lose previous pricing and need to purchase at current pricing. 

- **Can I distribute Sojourner.Pro to my colleagues?**

  If they are in your group or have any affiliation with you, then go ahead; if they are not affiliated in any way with you, and possibly have a group of themselves, you should refer them to purchase the subscription instead. They have 2 weeks to try it out and can cancel subscription with no question asked.  

  If you are to embed Sojourner.Pro source code inside of your software and redistribute under a different name. You can do so by purchasing an Appliance Licence of Sojourner.Pro. It allows you to distribute Sojourner.Pro as part of your application to each of your customers.



#### **2. Contribution to the Codebase**

Upon purchase of subscription, you are entitled to use the library and make changes to fit your needs. If you wish to contribute your code to the codebase of Sojourner.Pro, you will need to start a pull request, and assign the copyright of your modifications to PubLab before they can be accepted. 

This is purely to comply with the legal requirement for one to unambiguously own and sell commercial software products. It is not we trying to be a copyright hog, it is just how it works in legal system. This has been stated in the COMOS-Licence for clarity. 

You are encouraged to build applications on top of Sojourner.Pro. You retain all rights, including copyright, to any of your original work build upon Sojourner.Pro libraries; whereas all rights, including copyright, of your modifications to the Sojourner.Pro codebase, needs to be assigned to PubLab as the license require.

#### **3. Commercial Support**

Sojourner.Pro receives priority support via email upon subscription. For issues related to Sojourner, users are referred to help docs and wikis and the discussion forum which we are building currently, I will try to answer questions as I could.

To be able to put more time on the code development of the Pro, we limit support to1 incident per months per user, your email will be answered within 2 working days. Support is primarily for features and bugs related to Sojourner or Sojourner.Pro, not applications or infrastructure.
