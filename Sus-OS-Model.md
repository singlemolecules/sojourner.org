#### Sustainable Open Source Model Q&A

**Why PRO?**

*Sojourner.Pro* is still open source; with subscription you have access to the nightly built source code. It is worth noting that Open Source ! = Free. Free as in free beer, but in freedom. In fact, the not free part is an important component of the sustainable open source model, where the paid version of the open source software supports the development and maintenance of the free version. 

Open source is the right way of doing scientific computation project, as it allows continuous integration of latest development in the field of computation as well as microscopy. Yet the paradox of "project maintainer burn out when the project takes off" exists for every project. The community of users are then left to themselves when the code gets outdated. The commercialization of add-on features on top of an open source project by its maintainer, is one of the sustainable open source models proven successful for a number of projects. *Sojourner.Pro* is an attempt to make it work for everyone following such a sustainable open source model.

**Why should one pay money for PRO if he can resort to other open source libraries and build for free?**

This is an interesting topic. It can be answered at least from these four perspectives: 

1. Time. You can replicate something similar to what sojourner.pro is offering, by search and testing out those open source packages, modify and integrate them into your solution. The problem is you have to do all that work, of testing and validate various open source packages, written by different people, make sure they all work well together. It is a lot of time, can easily take tens or hundreds of hours before something that works, then you have to fix those bugs when people are using it. The alternative is, you can just buy it from one person who has done all that work already. 

   If your primary focus is on the disentangling of biological question, not making software for people to use, it may make sense to subscribe than to build from scratch; so you don’t have to maintain, integrate and test all these various open source packages. Instead put this time onto solving biological question or move forward with your publication at hand.

2. Support. Most open source project is created by people volunteering their spare time, and therefore can end anytime, especially when a project picked up by people and is taking off. With the increasing demand for bug fixes or feature request, the maintainer could burn out easily. What if a problem suddenly develops in the middle of your final analysis for submission of a paper? without dedicated support this can take weeks or months to resolve. 

   Also, suppose a person in the lab has made the effort and build a “free” alternative to solve the problem at hand, two years later when the person moved on with his own business, the maintenance and support of the software becomes a problem. A subscription to an open source software will allow the freedom of modifying it to one’s own need to solve the problem and continuous integration of latest updates and dedicated support over time. 

3. Cost. Free can be more expensive at times. Baremetrics has made a [Build vs Buy](https://baremetrics.com/build-vs-buy) calculator. Let’s make an optimistic assumption that everything goes just as expected, a postdoc finds the required packages and build the full sets of features and tested it all work well together with a month, this is the cost of build and savings annually.

   The number spoken for themselves. It worth it when there is no solution what’s so ever. When there is already a commercial solution with dedicated support, it may make sense to buy than to build.  

4. Expertise. My physicist colleague and I have done scientific computation in soft matter physics and computational biology respectively for years (see information about our credentials here). We understand single molecule data and are familiar with available analysis algorithms. The expertise allows us to tackle a question more effective than someone who just enter the field, and in times when solving the problem is urgent, this can be a valuable asset.  

**Why subscribe rather than onetime fee?**

This one is easier to answer as most software nowadays has migrating to a subscription model. There are many rationales behind the transition, one can easily find on the web. I just want to point out for single molecule analysis in academic setting, a sustainable open source solution maybe of special value for research as the field is rapidly growing, new developments in imaging and analysis keeps coming out. This subscription to a commercial open source project allows continuously integration of latest updates and provides dedicated support over time.
