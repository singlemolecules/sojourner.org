*Sojourner* and its PRO add-on are both Open Source projects aim to facilitate single molecule trajectory analysis. One is free and supported by the community, the other requires subscription and supported by dedicated developers. Despite their difference, they work together to support each other, making them sustainable for the long term.   

**The Dev Team**

We welcome everyone who is interested in Open Source or Scientific Computing to contribute (here is a guide on why and how one can [contribute][contribute]). The following people are contributing to the development of the projects:

[Hin][Hin] had just joined the party, and is developing some cool features for *Sojourner*. 

We thank everyone who had contributed ideas, code snippets, bug report, feature request.... Thanks for being part of this attampting for an open source solution to single molecule data analysis.
